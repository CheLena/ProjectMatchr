# ProjectMatchr
Insight Data Science fellowship project

## Background
The demand for data scientists remains high across a wide variety of industries, and there are ample resources for aspiring data scientists to acquire the skills and experience needed to be competitive for these jobs. With the vast availability of resources, there are many publicly available data sets that have been overused and project ideas that have been overdone, making it hard to stand out or come up with novel ways to demonstrate one's data science capabilities.

To this end, ProjectMatchr is a tool to help aspiring data scientists brainstorm viable project ideas by seeing what's been done before.
